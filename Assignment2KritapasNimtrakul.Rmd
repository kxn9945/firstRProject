## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Wave Plot
```{r wave}
x <- seq(0,20,0.01)
y <- sin(x)
sin_df <- data.frame(x,y)
head(sin_df,10)
plot(x,y)
```

# Replicability and reproducibility
## Replicability
Scientific research should be replicable by other scientists.
"Scientific truths should be robust to repeated replications of the same experiment."
This will demonstrate that the result is not mere fluke.
Replicability refers to whether or not we can get similar result from different data when the experiment is carried under the same condition

## Reproducibility
Whether or not different scientists will yield the same results by repeating the analysis on the same data.

## Which one is more impactful
Replicability is a more achievable goals.
Reproducibility can be hard because of variables such as poorly organised amalgam of code and spreadsheets.
